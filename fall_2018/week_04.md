## Last week

I opened two pull requests on Shuttle Tracker:

- [Route scheduling](https://github.com/wtg/shuttletracker/pull/174)
- [Fix time parsing](https://github.com/wtg/shuttletracker/pull/176)

## This week

I am using a USGS/NASA dataset from the [Shuttle Radar Topography Mission](https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/SRTM) to add altitude data to Shuttle Tracker coordinates (routes, stops, vehicle locations).

## Blockers

Still waiting on reviews for my Shuttle Tracker PRs.
