## Last week

I opened three pull requests on the Shuttle Tracker:

- [Admins management command](https://github.com/wtg/shuttletracker/pull/165)
- [Set datafeed endpoint content type](https://github.com/wtg/shuttletracker/pull/169)
- [Do not allow static directory listings](https://github.com/wtg/shuttletracker/pull/170)

I also opened a fourth, [Prometheus metrics](https://github.com/wtg/shuttletracker/pull/168), but it is not yet ready for review.

On Pipeline, I continued to improve our WordPress importer. It grabs articles from poly.rpi.edu and creates representations of them in Pipeline.

## This week

I plan to knock some more items off of the Pipeline to do list. I also plan to flesh out my Shuttle Tracker Prometheus PR a little more and polish it up for review. I am in the process of reviewing the [Typescript](https://github.com/wtg/shuttletracker/pull/164) PR.

## Blockers

Virtually nothing. Just waiting on reviews for my Shuttle Tracker PRs, but I have enough other work to do in the meantime.
