## Last week

I improved the WordPress importer to grab more information about photos, i.e. their bylines and captions. I also worked on how photographers and photo captions are displayed on Pipeline article pages.

Had another meeting with Institute archivists, and I said I would look into how to have Pipeline generate WARC (web archive) files that they can grab and store indefinitely.

## This week

Going to work on our presentation for next Tuesday and Friday.

## Blockers

None at the moment.
