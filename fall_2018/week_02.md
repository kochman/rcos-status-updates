## Last week

I opened two pull requests on Pipeline:

- [Show subdecks on article pages](https://github.com/thepoly/pipeline/pull/73)
- [Add MIT license](https://github.com/thepoly/pipeline/pull/74)

Provided a rough review of Shuttle Tracker's [Typescript PR](https://github.com/wtg/shuttletracker/pull/164).

On Pipeline, I continued to improve our WordPress importer. It grabs articles from poly.rpi.edu and creates representations of them in Pipeline.

## This week

I'm planning to continue working on Pipeline's WordPress importer. Additionally, I'm going to plan a talk for RCOS.

I am also investigating adding altitude data to Shuttle Tracker coordinates (routes, stops, vehicle locations). This could be useful for augmented reality purposes.

## Blockers

Still waiting on reviews for my Shuttle Tracker PRs.
