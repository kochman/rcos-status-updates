## Last week

Gave a Pipeline presentation last week. Added new and improved _Poly_ logos. Merged newsletters in. Fixed some WordPress importer bugs related to articles that are written by multiple authors. Also fixed some bugs around importing article photos. Added _Poly_-specific branding to the Wagtail admin panel.

## This week

Things are looking pretty good for a late December/early January launch. There are several things that must be completed before we can go live. The goal is to iron them out and get Pipeline into a state that we can continue to publish news on, and then we can work on adding some more unique features in the coming semesters.

## Blockers

None at the moment.
