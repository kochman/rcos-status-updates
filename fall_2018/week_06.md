## Last week

Got a bunch of Shuttle Tracker pull requests merged, such as the administrators command and the TypeScript rewrite. Also met with an archivist in the library to discuss how Pipeline can better support archiving _Poly_ articles with their system.

## This week

Have a couple small Shuttle Tracker PRs still outstanding that I'm hoping to have conversations about getting merged.

## Blockers

Need to circle back around with the library on the format they want to see Pipeline's content in.
