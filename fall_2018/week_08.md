## Last week

Got a PR featuring RSS feeds, meta tags, and a sitemap merged into Pipeline. I worked a lot on email newsletter functionality. This involves letting people enter their email addresses to subscribe, exposing subscribers in a format expected by RPI's mail server, and then allowing an editor to compose a newsletter of existing articles inside of Pipeline.

I also worked on the WordPress importer, and it can now grab articles from sections besides news.

## This week

Going to see what I can do to get other people's work merged in. Also going to continue refining the newsletter functionality.

## Blockers

None at the moment.
