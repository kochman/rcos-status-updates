## Last week

Have good conversations going on a couple of my Shuttle Tracker pull requests. Reviewed part of the Shuttle Tracker's frontend TypeScript rewrite. Talked about NLP as it applies to extracting subjects from articles in Pipeline.

## This week

Going to continue working on getting my PRs merged.

## Blockers

None at the moment.
